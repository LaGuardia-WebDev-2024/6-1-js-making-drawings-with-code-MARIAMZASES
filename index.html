          Owls spend much of their waking time hunting for food. Many owl
          species are carnivores, or meat eaters.</span
        >
        Small, rodent-like mammals, such as voles and mice, are the primary prey
        for many owl species. An owl's diet may also include frogs, lizards,
        snakes, fish, mice, rabbits, birds, squirrels, and other creatures.
        Occasionally, Great Horned Owls might even find skunks tasty enough to
        eat. Some owls, like the Flammulated Owl eat insects almost exclusively.
        Animals that eat insects are called insectivores
